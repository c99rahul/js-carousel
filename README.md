This is a simple carousel built with plain JavaScript, which can be your starting point to build your own carousel solution.

If you are new to JavaScript, consider going through [this beginner's guide](https://blog.logrocket.com/build-image-carousel-from-scratch-vanilla-javascript/) that explains nearly everything that goes into this project. 

### Features

- Basic ARIA accessibility
- Autoplaying slides
- Pagination / Paged navigation
- Keyboard navigation
- General adaptation for differnt screen sizes
- Customizable styles

### Installation

Simply clone this repo in your local development environment and open `index.html` in your favorite web browser.

```shell
git clone https://github.com/c99rahul/js-carousel.git
```
The `style.css` file is as important as the `carousel.js` as it sets the stage for our carousel and its controls.

I'm working on another carousel solution called [Sway Carousel](https://github.com/c99rahul/sway) which is based on this project but carries some advanced features like showing multiple slides at a time, fading effects, and more.
